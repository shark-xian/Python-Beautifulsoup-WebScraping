## Summary

Various Python utility functions, mostly geared towards dataviz and used to create visualisations such as this [bar chart](images/example1.png), [time chart](images/example2.png), [periodic table](images/example3.png)  and [image grid](images/example4.png).

The modules aren't properly packaged up or pip-able but are reasonably simple, generic and docstringed. They are not optimised for speed or tested for resilience. They are targeted at for-fun, interactive work.
