## Summary

Various Python 3 utility functions, mostly geared towards dataviz and used to create visualisations such as this [bar chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Udzu/pudzu/master/images/chart_elections_full.png), [time chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Udzu/pudzu/master/images/chart_g7_full.png), [periodic table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Udzu/pudzu/master/images/chart_periodic_full.png)  and [image grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Udzu/pudzu/master/images/chart_40under40_full.png).

The modules aren't properly packaged up or pip-able (yet) but are reasonably simple, generic and docstringed. They are not optimised for speed or tested for resilience. They are targeted at for-fun, interactive work.
